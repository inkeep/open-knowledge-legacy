# Run `bun run knip` and fail if it mutated the working tree.
#
# As of Phase B (#500), the `knip` script no longer passes
# `--fix-type exports --fix-type types`, so knip should not modify
# files in normal operation — it only reports findings and exits
# non-zero on findings, which fails CI directly. This wrapper is
# kept as a defensive guard against the `--fix-type` flag being
# reintroduced in the future: auto-fixes in CI sandboxes never
# reach main, but they DO produce code biome rejects (e.g. `export
# { X } from 'foo'` → bare `;`, see PR #283), which then fails
# the subsequent `bun run lint`.
#
# Compares `git diff` before/after, exits non-zero if knip added new
# modifications. Developer WIP changes are preserved — only NEW
# mutations from knip trigger the failure. Review with `git diff` and
# either commit the cleanup or `git checkout --` to revert.
