# Run the audit-framework schema-snapshot generator in --check mode and fail
# if the committed `packages/core/schema-snapshot.json` does not match what
# the generator would produce against the currently-installed schema +
# active mdast plugin chain. Mirrors the `check-knip-clean.sh` and
# `check-notices-clean.sh` patterns so `bun run check` catches drift
# before push.
#
# This snapshot is the canonical contract: drift here means downstream
# tooling reads stale schema data. The gate is what keeps the committed
# snapshot current.
