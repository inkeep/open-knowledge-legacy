## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ddd4efc: feat(agent-writes): optional `summary` on all four MCP write tools — renders as collapsible bullets on the Timeline row so readers can scan agent intent without opening every diff.

  Agents calling `write_document`, `edit_document`, `rename_document`, or `rollback_to_version` can now pass an optional one-line `summary` describing the outcome of the edit (e.g. `"Fixed token-refresh race"`). Summaries persist per-contributor to the shadow-repo `ok-contributors:` JSON line and render under the author on the [[timeline]] WIP row — first bullet inline, the rest collapsed behind a "Show N more" expander matching the existing `WipGroup` pattern. The doc-list stays visible as ground truth alongside the bullets.

  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` — `ShadowContributor` gains `summaries?: string[]` (flat per-contributor array, oldest-first). `parseContributors` accepts both legacy (no field) and new shapes; malformed `summaries` values drop just that field while preserving the contributor entry — a deliberate divergence from the whole-entry-skip convention so decorative loss (no bullets) never escalates to attribution loss.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` — new `agent-write-summary.ts` exports `normalizeSummary` as the single API-boundary truncation point (80-char cap, U+2026 suffix when truncated; whitespace-only and empty strings classify as `absent`). `recordContributor` threads through the optional 5th-arg summary; `formatContributorsFrom` emits `summaries` on the `ok-contributors:` line only when non-empty so summary-less writes stay byte-identical to today. Five API handlers (`/api/agent-write`, `/api/agent-write-md`, `/api/agent-patch`, `/api/rename`, `/api/rollback`) accept the optional body field and return `summary: {value, truncatedFrom?}` + a human-readable hint when truncation fires. Three new metrics counters (`agentWriteCalls`, `summariesProvided`, `summariesTruncated`) track M1 adoption and M2 cap efficacy. `handleRename` and `handleRollback` now call `extractAgentIdentity` + `recordContributor` — **but only when the request body carries an explicit `agentId`** (D22 LOCKED), so the in-editor Restore button (which posts with no identity) stays anonymous on the timeline as it always has. MCP-driven rename and rollback calls get a server-generated default summary (`"Renamed <from> → <to>"` / `"Restored to <sha-short>"`) when the agent omits one.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge` — the four write MCP tools expose `summary` in their Zod schemas (Zod hard-cap of 200 chars as a transport-safety bound separate from the 80-char rendering cap); `rename_document` and `rollback_to_version` also thread agent identity (`agentId`/`agentName`/`clientName`/`colorSeed`) matching the pattern from `write-document.ts` so summary attribution lands correctly. Tool descriptions include the cap, the rename/rollback defaults, and a no-PII/secrets hint.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` — `TimelinePanel` `EntryRow` renders the collapsible bullet list when any contributor on the row has `summaries`; zero regression for legacy rows without the field. The doc-list line stays as ground truth alongside the bullets.

  The `ok-contributors:` JSON line stays at `v: 1` — `summaries` is purely additive (precedent #9). Legacy commits (no field) and summary-less writes (field omitted) both remain byte-identical to pre-feature behavior. `exec` / `read_document` enrichment carries the field through automatically via `history.contributors[*].summaries`.

- 5fdd555: feat(desktop): M5 — `@napi-rs/keyring` end-to-end verification in packaged build.

  Adds the verification layer that proves `@napi-rs/keyring` loads and round-trips inside `utilityProcess.fork()` in the packaged Electron app. The PR #166 auth substrate itself is unchanged — this milestone ships infrastructure for observing the substrate from outside the app (driver script) and from inside the renderer (gated debug IPC), so R15 (utilityProcess compat) and R16 (`CFBundleDisplayName` prompt + bundle-ID stability + upsert semantics) become empirically verifiable.

  New surfaces:

  - `packages/desktop/src/utility/keyring-smoke.ts` — `runKeyringSmoke(deps?)` primitive. Namespace-scoped round-trip (`open-knowledge-smoke` / `test-user`) via `@napi-rs/keyring`; cleans up on success. Injectable `deps` parameter allows AC3 YAML-fallback unit coverage without touching the production substrate (SPEC §9 SCOPE lock). Returns `KeyringSmokeResult = { ok, backend, durationMs, timestamp, error? }`.
  - `packages/desktop/src/main/debug-ipc.ts` — renderer↔main↔utility relay. Correlation-ID `Map<id, {resolve,reject,timer}>` with 5 s default timeout; `clearTimeout` fires on both resolve and timeout paths so the Map stays bounded.
  - `packages/desktop/src/utility/server-entry.ts` — extends the IPC protocol with `{ kind: 'debug-request' }` dispatch. Also adds a boot-time auto-smoke mode gated on `OK_DEBUG_KEYRING_SMOKE=1`: writes `KeyringSmokeResult` JSON to `OK_DEBUG_KEYRING_SMOKE_OUT`, exits `0` post-write when `OK_DEBUG_KEYRING_SMOKE_EXIT=1`. This is the only creds-free path that exercises the hardened-runtime + fuses + signed-binary loader on packaged builds.
  - `packages/desktop/src/shared/{ipc-channels.ts,bridge-contract.ts}` + `packages/core/src/desktop-bridge.ts` + `packages/app/src/lib/desktop-bridge-types.ts` — add the `ok:debug:keyring-smoke` channel and the optional `debug?: { keyringSmoke(): Promise<KeyringSmokeResult> }` bridge namespace. The namespace is gated at preload time: `!app.isPackaged || process.env.OK_DEBUG_KEYRING_SMOKE === '1'`. In normal packaged runs, `window.okDesktop.debug` is `undefined` and typos surface at TypeScript compile time, not runtime.
  - `scripts/verify-keyring-in-packaged-dmg.mjs` — driver for creds-free pre-flight. Accepts an `.app` or `.dmg`, launches the packaged app with the `OK_DEBUG_KEYRING_SMOKE*` env triplet, parses the result JSON, exits `0` on ok / `1` on smoke failure / `2` on 30 s boot timeout / `3` on pre-smoke crash.
  - `packages/cli/src/auth/token-store.test.ts` — extended with upsert-semantics characterization tests + YAML-fallback mocking strategy. The production `token-store.ts` substrate is **unchanged** per SPEC §9 SCOPE lock; the new tests document and guard the substrate's already-correct behavior.
  - `packages/desktop/tests/smoke/keyring-e2e.md` — 11-step creds-gated manual runbook covering AC4 (CFBundleDisplayName prompt), AC5 (relaunch persistence), AC6 (v0.1.0→v0.1.1 upgrade persistence), AC7 (`log show` caller-attribution). Executable once Apple Developer credentials are on the test machine.

  Web and CLI distributions are unaffected — the debug namespace and env-var auto-smoke only fire in the Electron utility process, and the token-store test changes don't touch runtime behavior.

  Creds-free ACs (AC1–AC3, AC8–AC10) land green in this changeset. Creds-gated ACs (AC4–AC7) execute manually via the runbook and will attach screenshots + `log show` output to a follow-up status update once Apple credentials are available on the test machine (same external dependency that gates M2's end-state DOD).

- 05c7e37: feat(desktop): Electron desktop M1 — native macOS app with persistent Navigator launcher, per-project editor windows, and attach-to-existing-server.

  New private package `@inkeep/open-knowledge-desktop` launches Open Knowledge as a native macOS Electron app (dev loop only — signing, notarization, DMG, auto-update, URL scheme, keyring, MCP wiring, CLI-on-PATH menu are M2–M7). `bun run dev --filter=@inkeep/open-knowledge-desktop` opens a Navigator window with three cards (Clone from GitHub, Open folder on disk, Start fresh) + Recent list; every project pick spawns a new editor window per D3/D24 revised (no switch-in-place).

  Process model: one BrowserWindow ↔ one `utilityProcess.fork` ↔ one `createServer` ↔ one `contentDir` (D6), with a second branch that attaches to a live same-host `server.lock` instead of colliding — so a running `npx open-knowledge start` CLI and the desktop app cooperate on the same project. Typed IPC channel map (D14), hand-rolled preload bridge with contextBridge listener wrappers (D38 + electron/electron#33328), `utilityProcess.fork` with `windowLifecycleBound: true` (D39), macOS poll-based parent-death detection (D49), `shell.openExternal` scheme allowlist (D47), sandbox-compatible CommonJS preload.

  Server + core refactors that landed alongside:

  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` exports `bootServer(opts)` — the shared wrapper that composes `createServer()` + HTTP listener + server-lock port-write + optional `ok ui` sibling + idle-shutdown. CLI's `ok start` is now a thin wrapper over it; Electron's utility process calls it with `{ attachUiSibling: false, idleShutdownMs: null }`. Also emits permissive CORS headers for `/api/*` so cross-origin renderer fetches (Electron dev server → utility process) work.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` gains `OK_DIR` (moved from CLI) and the canonical `OkDesktopBridge` interface.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` ships `NavigatorApp.tsx` (Electron-only launcher), `WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx`, `CommandPalette.tsx` (Cmd+K), and `desktop-fetch.ts` — a renderer-side `/api/*` fetch rewriter that targets `window.okDesktop.config.apiOrigin` when present. `useCollabUrl` short-circuits on the same bridge config in Electron.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge` (CLI) is unchanged externally; internally `bootStartServer` delegates to `bootServer`.

  Web and CLI distributions are unaffected — `window.okDesktop` is undefined outside Electron, and every desktop-specific surface is gated on it.

- 39fa932: feat(desktop): M3 — Auto-update (electron-updater + install-on-quit).

  Wires `electron-updater@6.8.4` (exact-pinned, paired with `electron-builder@^26.9.0` via shared `builder-util-runtime@9.6.0`) into the Electron main process behind the `app.isPackaged` gate. Adds `.zip` to `mac.target` in `electron-builder.yml` so Squirrel.Mac's ZIP-based swap path has the artifact it needs (`MacUpdater.ts:89` downloads `.zip`, not `.dmg`).

  Main-process module at `packages/desktop/src/main/auto-updater.ts` subscribes six `autoUpdater` events (`checking-for-update`, `update-available`, `update-not-available`, `download-progress` debug-only, `update-downloaded`, `error`) and explicitly skips `login`, `update-cancelled`, `appimage-filename-updated`. Classified errors (`ERR_UPDATER_*` / `HTTP_ERROR_*`) and bare Squirrel.Mac Errors both log silently and retry on the next launch per parent J7a — no dialog, no nag.

  Three renderer toasts via the existing sonner mount in `packages/app/src/main.tsx` (all `duration: Infinity`, user-dismissable):

  - **Toast A** — `"Update downloaded"` + `"Relaunch now"` action button, fires once per pending-update version.
  - **Toast B** — `"Updated to v${VERSION} — see what's new"` with a link to the GitHub Releases tag, once per version transition.
  - **Toast C** — D12 stuck-update escape hatch: after 7 consecutive calendar days without a successful update check, fires once per installation with a link to the manual-download page.

  Four new `AppState` fields persist the toast gates (`versionPendingInstall`, `lastSeenVersion`, `lastSuccessfulCheckAt`, `stuckHintShown`), backwards-compatible with pre-M3 `state.json` via the existing defensive-coercion pattern in `parseAppState`.

  Periodic check every 1 hour (matching Obsidian UX per D10 revised), singleton-per-launch, cleared on `app.on('will-quit')`. Relaunch-now button invokes `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`; if the user dismisses the toast instead, `autoInstallOnAppQuit = true` still installs at next natural quit.

  Release pipeline: new `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` triggers on `release: published` (fired by `release.yml`'s `gh release create`) and runs `electron-builder --mac --publish always` on `macos-14` to upload `.dmg`, `.dmg.blockmap`, `.zip`, `.zip.blockmap`, and `latest-mac.yml` to the existing GitHub Release. Workflow lints + parses but its real-world execution is gated on M2's Apple-creds procurement and the universal-merge SHA-parity fix (M2 FU-1 / FU-2).

  Dev-mode smoke: `packages/desktop/scripts/smoke-mock-update.mjs` spins a local HTTP server with a hand-crafted `latest-mac.yml` + fake `.zip` so the wiring can be exercised end-to-end (short of the signature-verified Squirrel.Mac swap) before signed DMGs exist.

  Version bootstrap is governed by the `changesets fixed` group — `@inkeep/open-knowledge-desktop@0.0.0` bumps lockstep with its peers at next `release.yml` run; no hand-edit to `package.json`.

- 3ab7ae9: feat(desktop): M4 `openknowledge://` URL scheme end-to-end.

  Closes M4's DOD in the Electron desktop app. Clicking `openknowledge://open?project=<abs-path>&doc=<name>` from any surface (Terminal `open`, Mail/Slack hyperlinks, MCP tool responses in Claude Desktop) routes the user to the right project window with the renderer navigated to the target doc. Unblocks M6: MCP `preview-url.ts` now emits `openknowledge://` URLs when running inside Electron (gated on `OK_ELECTRON_PROTOCOL_HOST=1`, set at utility fork), and falls through to `http://localhost/...` for CLI/bunx consumers.

  Implementation details: synchronous top-level `open-url` listener registration (per electron/electron#32600 — `open-url` can fire before `will-finish-launching` OR `ready` on macOS); VS Code-style queue-then-flush with 10 × 500ms retries; `second-instance` argv scan for CLI-style launches; `realpathSync`-canonicalized `windowsByPath` keys; `dom-ready`-gated `sendDeepLink` on cold spawns to defeat subscriber-mount races; dev-mode `setAsDefaultProtocolClient('openknowledge')` with `before-quit` cleanup via `removeAsDefaultProtocolClient` (prevents stale Launch Services bindings to deleted worktrees). Path-traversal defense rejects null bytes (pre-decode + post-decode for layered `%2500` shapes), URL-decodes, then checks the raw decoded string for `..` segments before normalization — `path.resolve`'s silent-flatten behavior makes equality-style gates insufficient. `shell.openExternal` scheme allowlist (`https`, `http`, `mailto`, `openknowledge`) enforced at the main-process boundary per D47. Nested doc names (`notes/meeting-2026`) round-trip correctly via `encodeURIComponent` on both producer (preview-url) and consumer (renderer hash nav) sides.

  macOS-only v0 per D51. Windows/Linux NG1/NG2 paths remain `NOT NOW`. Cold-start Apple-Event delivery requires signed DMG + Launch Services binding — deferred to M3/M7 and captured as a named `test.skip` in `deep-link.e2e.ts` for explicit CI visibility.

  See `specs/2026-04-21-m4-url-scheme/SPEC.md` and parent `specs/2026-04-11-electron-desktop-app/SPEC.md` §14.

- 1f030ba: feat(presence): unify agent presence on `__system__` awareness (multi-agent)

  N concurrent agents (Claude + Cursor, two Claudes, etc.) now coexist in the presence bar as distinct badges. The previous per-content-doc awareness surface stomped because every Hocuspocus `Document` has one shared `Awareness` clientID — every agent's `setLocalState` overwrote the prior. Presence now lives on the `__system__` Y.Doc's awareness as a map-valued `agentPresence` field keyed by `agentId`.

  **Breaking (core):**

  - `AwarenessUser.type` narrowed from `'human' | 'agent'` to `'human'`. Agents no longer publish per-doc awareness — construct `AgentPresenceEntry` instead and call the server-side `AgentPresenceBroadcaster`. If you were reading `user.type === 'agent'` on per-doc awareness, that path is gone; read `agentPresence?` on `__system__.awareness` instead.
  - `AgentFocusEntry` type export removed. Use `AgentPresenceEntry` from `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core`.
  - `AwarenessState.agentFocus?` field removed. Replaced by `agentPresence?: Record<string, AgentPresenceEntry>` on the same type.

  **Breaking (server):**

  - `AgentFocusBroadcaster` renamed to `AgentPresenceBroadcaster`. API replaced: `setFocus`/`clearFocus`/`getFocusMap` → `setPresence(agentId, entry)`, `clearPresence(agentId)`, `touchMode(agentId, mode)`, `getPresenceMap()`. Entry shape now `{displayName, icon, color, currentDoc, mode, ts}` (was `{agentName, currentDoc, writeKind, ts}`).
  - `ServerInstance.agentFocusBroadcaster` renamed to `agentPresenceBroadcaster`.
  - `ApiExtensionOptions.agentFocusBroadcaster` renamed to `agentPresenceBroadcaster`.
  - New endpoint `GET /api/metrics/agent-presence` returns the presence map for operator diagnostics (not polled by the browser).

  **CLI:**

  - MCP keepalive URL now carries `&agentId=${connectionId}` so the server can deterministically clear presence on process exit. Older MCP clients without the param fall back gracefully to the 5s TTL filter.

  **Client:**

  - `PresenceBar` renders sectioned: current-doc agents + humans | divider | cross-doc agents (dimmed). Cross-doc agents are now keyboard-accessible — the avatar itself is a button with an aria-label describing the target doc; clicking navigates.
  - `-space-x-1.5` (overlapping avatars) replaced with `gap-1.5` so 2+ agents render side-by-side cleanly (triage #1 fix).

- 267c8ba: feat(handoff): "Open in Agent Desktop" — one-click handoff from Open Knowledge to Claude Cowork / Claude Code / OpenAI Codex Desktop / Cursor.

  A new "Open in…" dropdown surfaces from three places — the editor header action strip, the `Cmd+K` command palette ("Open in agent" group), and the file-tree right-click menu — routing every click through a single `dispatchHandoff` entry point (AC9 asserts no other dispatch sites). Each enabled row fires the target's canonical URL scheme through the existing `shell.openExternal` IPC (Electron host) or an anchor-click (web host), with a minimal auto-composed prompt that points the target agent at the doc plus a hint to use the `open-knowledge` MCP for backlinks + related context. Disabled rows render with a keyboard-reachable submenu — install link + `Open in claude.ai →` secondary affordance on Claude rows — instead of a non-interactive tooltip.

  Built on four pure URL builders in the new `packages/core/src/handoff/` (`claude-url.ts`, `codex-url.ts`, `cursor-url.ts`, `web-fallback-url.ts`) with an encoding discipline pinned against Cursor's two-pass-decode behavior (`text=` double-encoded, `workspace=` single-encoded basename, `mode=agent` literal). The Cursor two-step dispatcher (`cursor-two-step.ts`, Electron only per E4 DIRECTED) spawns the workspace first through a dedicated `ok:shell:spawn-cursor` IPC — distinct from the URL-scheme allowlist because the threat model is a command allowlist — then fires the `cursor://` prompt after a 1000–1500 ms settle. On macOS the spawn routes through `/usr/bin/open -a <bundle>` because `app.getApplicationInfoForProtocol('cursor://')` returns the `.app` bundle (a directory), not an executable.

  Install detection is unified across hosts: Electron uses `app.getApplicationInfoForProtocol(scheme)` per probe (with an `xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/<name>` fallback on Linux); web uses a new `GET /api/installed-agents` endpoint with a per-scheme 60 s server-side cache, a 10 s per-client refresh throttle, and the standard `checkLocalOpSecurity` loopback + Host-header gate. Windows probes the merged `HKCR` view so machine-scope (HKLM) installers are detected alongside user-scope. Web-host Cursor is always disabled-with-tooltip regardless of probe result (E4 DIRECTED — local-use-case only; the `/api/handoff/open-folder` cross-machine primitive is deferred).

  Security: `packages/desktop/src/main/shell-allowlist.ts` (D47) extended with `claude:`, `codex:`, `cursor:` behind per-scheme JSDoc and an exact-set test. A drift-detector in `shell-allowlist.test.ts` reads `KNOWN_TARGETS` and fails if any future target lands without an allowlist row. Every outbound URL is built by a typed pure function — never from user-supplied raw URL strings.

  Observability: `~/.open-knowledge/stats.jsonl` append-only per dispatch (zero phone-home per XQ3 LOCKED). Success/failure sonner toasts close the DC3/DC4/vendor-drift silent-failure gap, with a bounded retry (2–3 attempts; distinct copy on the final failure) per review M5. Full spec with decision log + test plan at `specs/2026-04-21-open-in-agent-desktop/SPEC.md`; end-user guide at `docs/content/guides/open-in-agent-desktop.mdx`.

- cb8901b: feat(presence): use git-config name for the human presence avatar; dedupe tabs of the same checkout

  The presence bar now shows the user's actual name (from `git config user.name`) and a deterministic per-principal color, instead of a random `Adjective Animal` nickname. Multi-tab users see ONE avatar with a tooltip like `"Miles Kaming-Thanassi · 2 tabs"` instead of N copies. Users on a fresh box without git config keep the existing animal-fallback experience — no regression.

  Cursor labels and tooltips polish Unix-style names: `miles-kt-inkeep` floats `Miles Kt Inkeep` next to selections, matching the `MK` initials the avatar already shows.

  The data plumbing reuses an existing fetch — `DocumentContext` already calls `GET /api/principal` for the auth-token claim — and threads the resolved principal into a new optional `principalId?: string` field on `AwarenessUser`. `usePresence()` dedupes humans whose `principalId` matches; cursors stay per-clientId so N tabs editing still render N cursors in the editor.

  **API surface:**

  - New optional wire field `AwarenessUser.principalId` on per-doc awareness (loopback-only trust today; non-loopback connections must switch to server-authoritative attribution at `onAuthenticate`).
  - New public exports from `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core`: `Principal` (now an alias of the schema-inferred `PrincipalResponse`), `PrincipalResponseSchema`, `PrincipalResponse`, `computeInitials`, `formatPresenceLabel`, `HUMAN_COLORS`.
  - `colorFromSeed` now accepts an optional `palette` parameter; the default remains `AGENT_COLORS` so existing single-arg callers are byte-equivalent.
  - `HumanParticipant` from `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` (internal) gains `tabCount: number`.
  - `localStorage` cache keys for the random-fallback identity move from `ok-user-{name,color}-v2` to `-v3`. No migration — pre-launch state.

  **Hardening:**

  - `GET /api/principal` now requires loopback + Host-header gates so PII (`display_name`, `display_email`) doesn't leak under `--host 0.0.0.0` deployments. Matches the gate `/api/metrics/agent-presence` and `/api/workspace` already enforce.
  - `PrincipalResponseSchema.display_name` and `display_email` use `.min(1)` so an empty git-config value routes through the silent random-identity fallback rather than rendering an empty initial / blank tooltip / blank cursor label.

- 48d4218: feat(shadow-repo): collapse dual-mode to single-mode at `<projectRoot>/.git/open-knowledge/`, auto-`git init` on first run when no parent repo exists, and rename legacy `.git/openknowledge/` shadows in place.

  The shadow repo (OK's attribution journal for WIP refs, upstream imports, checkpoints, and the rescue timeline) previously branched between `integrated` mode at `<root>/.git/openknowledge/` and `standalone` mode at `<root>/.openknowledge/`. Standalone mode had semantically distinct behavior — no parent `.git/HEAD` for the HEAD watcher, no real project branch for the `refs/wip/<branch>/<writer-id>` namespace, no upstream-import path — which forced every shadow-touching change through a two-mode test matrix for zero user-facing payoff. The dual-mode split is now gone: the shadow always lives at `<projectRoot>/.git/open-knowledge/`, projects without `.git/` get auto-`git init`'d by the new `ensureProjectGit` helper (fail-fast on missing git — no degraded fallback), and legacy `.git/openknowledge/` shadows are silently `renameSync`-migrated on first run so pre-spec users keep their attribution history.

  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` — `resolveShadowDir(projectRoot: string): string` — return type collapses from `{ path, mode }` to a plain string; `ShadowRepoMode` and `ResolvedShadowDir` types are deleted. `OkDesktopBridge` gains `onGitInitNotice(cb)` alongside the existing `onProjectSwitched` / `onMenuAction` push-event surfaces.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` — new `ensureProjectGit` + `ProjectGitInitError` exports (pre-listen fail-fast hook). `BootServerOptions` gains `ensureProjectGitFn`; `BootedServer` gains `didGitInit`. `initShadowRepo` carries a ~5-line R9 rename shim for legacy layouts. `skipAutoInit` now gates both `ensureProjectGitFn` and `autoInitFn`.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge` — `ok start` and `ok init` call `ensureProjectGit(cwd)` in the fresh-directory path; the CLI preview-block gate extends to `didAutoInit || didGitInit` and emits `Initialized git repo at <cwd>/.git/ (default branch: main)`. `ok mcp` is unchanged directly but inherits the side effect transitively when it auto-spawns `ok start` (opt out with `OK_MCP_AUTOSTART=0` or config `mcp.autoStart: false`). `.gitignore` auto-append of `.openknowledge/` is deleted; `.openknowledge` is removed from `enrichment.ts` / `mtime-scan.ts` scan-exclusion sets.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-desktop` — utility process passes `ensureProjectGitFn` to `bootServer`; `UtilityReadyMessage` carries `didGitInit`. New `git-init-notice` push event on the preload bridge; main-side dispatch deferred until `webContents.once('dom-ready', ...)` to defeat the subscriber-mount race.
  - `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` — renderer subscriber (`lib/install-git-init-toast.ts`, wired imperatively in `main.tsx`) routes `onGitInitNotice` to `toast.info(\`Initialized git repo at ${gitDir}\`)`. No-op outside Electron.

  Legacy `.openknowledge/` standalone-mode directories are silent orphans (no detection, no warning, no migration) — OK carries zero runtime reference to that path per D5/NG5. Worktree-specific semantics are out of scope for this change; they remain owned by a separate spec (NG6).

  Full spec + decision log (D1–D14, R1–R9): [`specs/2026-04-21-shadow-repo-single-mode/SPEC.md`](specs/2026-04-21-shadow-repo-single-mode/SPEC.md).

### Patch Changes

- fa8f5de: fix(outline): skip `#` comments inside fenced code blocks when extracting headings

  Previously, `extractHeadings` scanned line-by-line with a naive ATX regex and counted any `# …` as a heading — including lines inside ` ```yaml `, ` ```bash `, or ~~~ code blocks. TipTap's WYSIWYG DOM correctly renders those as code, so the outline's heading list grew one entry longer than the DOM, and every click after the first fenced `#` scrolled to the _next_ real heading instead of the intended one (most visibly: clicking "9) Risks / unknowns" in a spec with a YAML fence landed on "10) Decision Log").

  The source-mode outline click handler had the symmetric bug — its own line scan also double-counted fenced `#` lines.

  Both now delegate to a shared `createCodeFenceTracker` helper in core that follows CommonMark §4.5 fence semantics (3+ backticks or tildes, ≤3 leading spaces, closing fence matches opening char and length, no closing info string).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7fb215b: feat(bridge): correctness guardrail, silent recovery UX, and settlement-based propagation for the dual-CRDT observer bridge (Y.XmlFragment ↔ Y.Text).

  **Paired-write symmetry (Bucket 0).** Adds a typed `context.paired: true` marker to the four origins that atomically write both CRDTs inside one `doc.transact()` block — `AGENT_WRITE_ORIGIN`, `FILE_WATCHER_ORIGIN`, `ROLLBACK_ORIGIN`, `MANAGED_RENAME_ORIGIN`. Server Observer A and Server Observer B now short-circuit symmetrically on paired-write drains via a semantic predicate (`context.paired === true`), closing the prior Observer-B asymmetry that could re-propagate RGA-level corruption under concurrent typing. `MANAGED_RENAME_ORIGIN` is now exported and included in `BRIDGE_ENFORCING_ORIGINS`.

  **Loud-on-content-loss merge (Bucket A).** `mergeThreeWay` now asserts a maximal-unique-line-substring post-condition with a weak order-preservation side-check (`assertContentPreservation`). Violations throw `BridgeMergeContentLossError` in tests so regressions surface; production swallows the error, emits a structured `bridge-merge-content-loss` JSON log, and queues a silent named checkpoint via the new `saveInMemoryCheckpoint` shadow-repo primitive so the editor keeps responding. Users can recover the pre-merge state via the existing TimelinePanel — no toast, no banner. The algorithm's academic-proven limits (Khanna-Kunal-Pierce 2007) are turned into observable, recoverable events rather than silent byte loss.

  **TimelinePanel kind-aware rendering.** Checkpoint rows render with distinct icon + label per kind: `Save Version` (diamond, existing), `bridge-merge-loss` (amber alert-triangle, "Before concurrent merge @ …"), `external-change-rescue` (sky file-archive, "External change recovered @ …"). Pure helpers `checkpointVariant` + `checkpointHeadlineLabel` are exported for tests.

  **Rescue-buffer consolidation.** Reconcile-delete and branch-switch rescue paths now write `external-change-rescue` checkpoints to `refs/checkpoints/<branch>/*` via `saveInMemoryCheckpoint`. `/api/rescue` + `/api/rescue/:docName` merge flat-file (shutdown-flush, retained) and timeline-ref (new) sources — response rows carry a `source: 'flat' | 'timeline'` discriminator.

  **Settlement-based observer dispatch (Bucket B).** Server Observer A + Observer B now run from `doc.on('afterAllTransactions', ...)` — one fire per outermost `doc.transact()` drain, Observer A before Observer B so any Y.Text write from A is visible to B. The 50 ms wall-clock debounce is gone. Client observer debounce machinery is deleted (per precedent #14, the client is baseline-only). A new grep gate (`packages/server/src/bridge-no-wallclock.test.ts`) fails CI if wall-clock `setTimeout` reappears in either bridge-observer file.

  **Telemetry.** New `bridgeMergeContentLoss` and `bridgeMergeCheckpointCreated` counters exposed via the existing `GET /api/metrics/reconciliation` endpoint. Structured log events (`bridge-merge-content-loss`, `bridge-merge-checkpoint-created`) follow the existing JSON-log convention.

  **Elevated fuzz coverage.** `bridge-convergence.fuzz.test.ts` now runs 200 seeds per PR (`STRESS_FUZZ_PR=1`, wired in `ci.yml`), 10 000 seeds nightly (`STRESS_FUZZ_NIGHTLY=1`, wired in `nightly.yml`), and logs the resolved seed count at startup for CI visibility. Default local runs remain 25 seeds to keep the dev loop fast.<br>_[Corrected 2026-04-19 post-ship: automated fuzz tier removed from CI and nightly per `specs/2026-04-19-ci-signal-quality/SPEC.md` (FR-2 / D-Q1 LOCKED). `STRESS_FUZZ_PR` and `STRESS_FUZZ_NIGHTLY` env wirings deleted from both workflows; the fuzz test file is preserved and invoked ad-hoc via `bun run measure:fuzz`.]_

  **Fuzz structural quiescence.** Tests now use `awaitDocQuiescence(doc)` instead of `wait(ms)` around `pauseSync`/`resumeSync` — race reproduction is event-ordered, not wall-clock.

  Precedents #1, #11(b), and #13(b) in `AGENTS.md` are updated to reflect the shipped behavior.

### Minor Changes

- 07161e2: feat: canonical clipboard pipeline with mdast as the intermediate hub for all four clipboard paths (WYSIWYG copy/paste, Source copy/paste)

  - **Shared conversion modules**: `htmlToMdast()` + `mdastToMarkdown()` in `markdown/html-to-mdast.ts` wrap `rehype-parse` → vendor-cleanup plugins → `rehype-remark`. `markdownToHtml()` + `mdastToHtml()` in `markdown/mdast-to-html.ts` wrap `remark-rehype` → custom-node handlers → `rehype-stringify`. Both views share the same conversion path — no per-view special cases.
  - **Vendor cleanup plugins**: day-one panel of 9 rehype plugins under `markdown/rehype-plugins/` covering Google Docs, Word/MSO, Apple Cocoa (Notes/Mail/TextEdit), Gmail, Notion, VS Code, Google Sheets, Slack, and GitHub-rendered HTML. Each ships with a colocated test and a real captured paste sample as fixture. Registered in `cleanupPlugins` (also exported).
  - **Custom-node mdast promotion**: `wikiLink`, `jsxComponent` (as `mdxJsxFlowElement`), `jsxInline` (as `mdxJsxTextElement`), and `rawMdxFallback` are first-class mdast types with dedicated serialization handlers — markdown side emits canonical `[[Page]]` / `<Component/>`, HTML side emits semantic elements with `data-*` round-trip metadata (e.g. wikiLink → `<a class="wiki-link" data-target data-anchor data-alias href="#slug">`). Replaces the prior `{type:'html',value:...}` passthrough.
  - **FR-20 escape discipline**: raw source from MDX / fallback nodes lands in hast `text` nodes (auto-escaped by `rehype-stringify`), never hast `html`. Unit and fuzz tests assert no unescaped `<script>` in output.
  - **Chunked Y.Text insertion**: `chunkedYTextInsert()` in `utils/chunked-insert.ts` splits large pastes (>500KB markdown) into ~50KB segments separated by `requestAnimationFrame` to keep UI responsive on iOS Safari and slower desktops.
  - **New public exports from `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core`**: `htmlToMdast`, `mdastToMarkdown`, `htmlToMdastCleanupPlugins`, `HtmlToMdastOptions`, `markdownToHtml`, `mdastToHtml`, `chunkedYTextInsert`, `DEFAULT_CHUNK_THRESHOLD_BYTES`, `DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES`, `InsertableYText`, `InsertableYDoc`, `ChunkedInsertOptions`.
  - **Precedent**: clipboard pipeline architecture codified as precedent #19 in `AGENTS.md` — mdast-canonical hub, per-view hook mechanism (PM's `clipboardTextSerializer`/`clipboardSerializer` for WYSIWYG, `EditorView.domEventHandlers` for Source), first-class custom-node mdast types, full 9-plugin cleanup panel day-one.

- 50a5d7f: feat: replace @tiptap/markdown with unified + remark pipeline

  - Swap markdown parsing/serialization from marked + @tiptap/markdown to unified + remark-parse + remark-gfm + remark-frontmatter + remark-mdx + @handlewithcare/remark-prosemirror
  - Rename ProseMirror schema nodes to mdast-canonical names: bold→strong, italic→emphasis, horizontalRule→thematicBreak, separate bulletList/orderedList→unified list+listItem
  - Add source-form fidelity preservation via position-slice walker (delimiter, fence, bullet marker recovery)
  - Add D20 escapeMark for backslash-escape round-trip of structurally-ambiguous characters
  - Add R23 autolink/void-HTML guard for remark-mdx coexistence
  - Public MarkdownManager.parse()/serialize() API preserved — no consumer changes required

### Patch Changes

- 3eb50c2: fix(bridge): close Bug-A (server-side `syncTextToFragment` destroying concurrent client XmlFragment) and Bug-B (client Observer A's remote-tx baseline refresh absorbing local changes). Server-side agent writes now follow the XmlFragment-authoritative pattern (`applyAgentMarkdownWrite` replaces `syncTextToFragment`). Client Observer A uses conditional baseline refresh when a local debounce is pending. Extracts `applyByPrefixSuffix` to `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` for shared use. Hardens the bridge-testing harness (FR-11 invariant watcher, FR-12 origin probe, FR-15 Scheduler DI with clock unification, FR-16 network control, FR-17 multi-client convergence fuzzer with char-granular content oracle).
- e8f4dd8: Markdown pipeline engineering health — 21 P0 requirements landing across perf measurement, code refactors, fidelity fixes, test tightening, and CI infrastructure.

  **Perf measurement:** seeded synthetic benchmark corpus + committed harness with pinned methodology (10 warm-ups, `Bun.gc(true)`, `bun@1.3.11`); re-measured baseline at 7 block counts; per-stage profile harness + published findings; calibrated perf regression gate (`max(2× p99 variance, 10% floor)`) + parse-health gate (`parseFallback.wholeDoc === 0`) in tier-2 CI.

  **Code refactors:** R23 guard `O(n·m) → O(n log n)` via pre-indexed tag-offset map + binary search (568.88ms → 4.76ms on pathological corpus); processor caching at `MarkdownManager` construction + idempotency refactor for both `remarkMdxAgnostic` and `remarkWikiLink` attachers; 2-phase merged post-parse walker (Phase A restoration + Phase B merged dispatcher) gated by one-time byte-for-byte mdast diff validator on 714 fixtures; structural PM↔mdast fix — `hydrateMarks` outside-in greedy (library patch), `Code` mark `excludes: '_'` widened via `CodeMarkFidelity` (schema widening per precedent #9), context-aware backslash-before-entity policy.

  **Fidelity:** all 6 CommonMark serialization bugs fixed. CommonMark corpus 652/652 idempotent; `KNOWN_CRASH_CEILING` lowered from 50 to 0; all 19 formerly-NORMALIZE sections promoted to byte-identity idempotence assertion.

  **Test tightening:** NG1 + NG11 byte-identity pinning; I3's `markdownDoc` arbitrary parametric blank-line joiner; 6 new PBT invariants (emphasis-cumulation, backslash-idempotence, list-nesting, html-block-edge, link-edge, image-edge) green at 1K samples; `parseWithFallback` perf bound (≤5× happy-path) + parametric `MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH` boundary test.

  **Infrastructure:** all markdown fixtures consolidated into `packages/core/src/markdown/fixtures/{commonmark,gfm,mdx,wiki-links,frontmatter,ng-pinned,perf}/` with typed loader helpers; all 7 stale `@tiptap/markdown` references removed; three CI tiers (`ci.yml` / `nightly.yml` / `weekly.yml`) calibrated against measured baselines.
