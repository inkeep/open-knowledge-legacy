/**
 * R17 — 2-phase merged post-parse walker (Phase B).
 *
 * Phase A (`restoreFromMdx` in `autolink-void-html-guard.ts`) runs first as
 * its own visitor pass; it restores PUA sentinels to literal `<`, `>`, `:`,
 * `@`, `{` inside text/URL/title/alt fields. That phase stays standalone
 * because Phase B's pass 2 (autolink promotion) regex-matches on the
 * literal `<` and `>` characters Phase A restores — a single same-node
 * visitor cannot satisfy that ordering (see
 * `specs/2026-04-16-markdown-pipeline-engineering-health/evidence/pipeline-refactor-audit.md`
 * §R17).
 *
 * Phase B — this module — merges the four previously-separate post-parse
 * transformers into a single `unist-util-visit` traversal:
 *
 *   Pass 2: `autolinkPromotionPlugin`  — `<scheme:uri>` text → semantic link
 *   Pass 3: `docStartThematicFixPlugin` — root-position empty yaml → thematicBreak
 *   Pass 4: `positionSlicePlugin`      — attach source-form data to node.data
 *   Pass 5: `unknownMdastGuardPlugin`  — unknown type → rawMdxFallbackMdast
 *
 * ### Dispatch strategy
 *
 * 1. Pass 3 runs once outside the visit, as a tree-level pre-step. Only fires
 *    when `tree.children[0]` is a root-position empty yaml node; the mutation
 *    replaces that yaml node with one-or-more synthesized `thematicBreak`s.
 *    Handling it as a pre-step keeps the inner visit callback simple and
 *    preserves the exact byte-sequence of the pre-merge pipeline — when the
 *    visit subsequently descends into the new thematicBreak(s), pass 4's
 *    position-slice logic overwrites `data.sourceRaw` with an identical
 *    value sliced from `source` for the first thematicBreak (position
 *    attached) and leaves it untouched for later ones (position absent →
 *    pass 4 early-returns, preserving the pre-set value).
 *
 * 2. For every other node the merged visit callback runs in this order:
 *
 *    a. **Pass 5 first, with `SKIP`.** If `node.type` is not in
 *       `KNOWN_MDAST_TYPES`, replace `parent.children[index]` with a
 *       fallback and return `SKIP` so the visitor does not descend into
 *       the removed node's children. Correctness: the pre-merge pipeline
 *       runs passes 2 and 4 on unknown nodes too, but their mutations are
 *       either (a) discarded when pass 5 substitutes (data attachment)
 *       or (b) preserved only on sibling nodes at the parent level
 *       (promotion of autolinks in OTHER text siblings of the parent
 *       happens during the PARENT's callback, not the unknown child's).
 *       Running pass 5 first and SKIP-ping is byte-identically equivalent
 *       and measurably faster on unknown-heavy inputs.
 *
 *    b. **Pass 2** — autolink promotion. Fires on any node with a
 *       `children` array containing at least one text child. Mutates
 *       `node.children` in place via `promoteInParent`. Newly-synthesized
 *       children lack positions and are visited normally on descent;
 *       pass 4 will early-exit on missing-position nodes.
 *
 *    c. **Pass 4** — position slice. Attaches `data.sourceDelimiter`,
 *       `data.sourceRaw`, `data.escapedChars`, etc. Reads the ORIGINAL
 *       source (swapped back into `file.value` by `parseMd` before the
 *       transformer runs) so authoring-form chars are preserved.
 *
 * ### Why `unist-util-visit` as the outer loop
 *
 * Pass 2 reassigns `parent.children` mid-visit. `unist-util-visit`'s
 * index-based iteration handles this correctly — adding/removing later
 * siblings is picked up without an index return, removing earlier siblings
 * requires returning a new index. A custom tree-walker would re-introduce
 * the class of bug this refactor is eliminating.
 *
 * ### Acceptance
 *
 * Byte-for-byte mdast equivalence across the full fixture corpus was the
 * correctness proof for the 5-pass → 2-phase refactor. The one-time
 * validator (`evidence/r17-mdast-equivalence.{ts,md}` + `r17-run-diff.ts`)
 * shipped with US-007 and was deleted after US-008 went green, per
 * PRECEDENTS.md precedent #17 (byte-identity validators are ratchets, not
 * regression tests). The architectural record — why the phase split is
 * load-bearing and what ordering constraints apply — lives in
 * `specs/2026-04-16-markdown-pipeline-engineering-health/evidence/pipeline-refactor-audit.md`
 * §R17. The unit tests in `merged-walker.test.ts` cover per-node dispatch;
 * the broader fidelity corpus + R19 parse-health gate + R4 perf regression
 * gate together cover end-to-end correctness going forward.
