/**
 * Transaction origin for the persistence-hook config-doc revert path
 * (D45 Layer 3 / D58 / FR-34).
 *
 * Object reference per precedent #1 — identity-based matching in the
 * `onStoreDocument` config-doc branch's entry-gate (`if
 * (lastTransactionOrigin === CONFIG_VALIDATION_REVERT_ORIGIN) return`).
 *
 * `skipStoreHooks: true` is the primary defense against a revert →
 * validate → revert loop; the entry-gate is belt-and-suspenders. The
 * revert transaction body replaces Y.Text content with the in-memory
 * LKG cache; `skipStoreHooks` prevents Hocuspocus from firing
 * `onStoreDocument` for the revert itself, so the hook never re-validates
 * what is already known to be the last good state.
 *
 * NOT a paired-write origin (D58, D41 — bridge is bypassed for config
 * docs at `server-observer-extension.ts:50`). No `paired: true` flag —
 * adding one would route this origin through `isPairedWriteOrigin`'s
 * settlement-handler short-circuit, which is wrong: the revert is a
 * Y.Text-only mutation with no XmlFragment counterpart.
