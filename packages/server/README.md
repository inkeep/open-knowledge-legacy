# @inkeep/open-knowledge-server

Hocuspocus CRDT server library — persistence, file-watcher, agent sessions, shadow repo, HTTP API, and the process-lock / idle-shutdown primitives that back the `ok start` / `ok ui` lifecycle. Embedded in the Vite dev server (`packages/app`) and the published CLI (`packages/cli`).

See root `CLAUDE.md` → "Package: server" for the full component inventory.

---

## Process-lock factory (`process-lock.ts`)

Single shared primitive for every per-content-directory lockfile owned by this repo.

```ts
import { acquireProcessLock } from '@inkeep/open-knowledge-server';

const handle = acquireProcessLock({
  lockName: 'server',                 // or 'ui'
  lockDir: '<contentDir>/.open-knowledge',
  metadata: { worktreeRoot },         // merged into the JSON payload
});

handle.updatePort(realPort);          // post-listen port mutation (ownership-guarded)
handle.release();                     // idempotent — only removes the lock when pid matches
```

- **JSON shape:** `{pid, hostname, port, startedAt, worktreeRoot}`. `port: 0` is the "starting, not yet bound" sentinel — consumers must re-read after the owner calls `updateProcessLockPort`.
- **Collision behavior:** a live same-host PID → throws `ProcessLockCollisionError`. Dead-pid / corrupt JSON / foreign-host locks → replaced with a warning. `ServerLockCollisionError` and `UiLockCollisionError` extend this error so existing `instanceof` callers keep working.
- **Thin adapters:** `server-lock.ts` pins `lockName: 'server'`; `ui-lock.ts` pins `lockName: 'ui'`. Both re-export typed `acquire*Lock` / `update*LockPort` / `read*Lock` / `release*Lock` / `*LockCollisionError`.

Defined by `specs/2026-04-16-zero-ceremony-resume/SPEC.md` §9 (US-001). Used by `createServer()`, `startUiServer()`, MCP spawn verification, and every lifecycle command (`status` / `stop` / `clean`).

---

## Idle-shutdown primitive (`idle-shutdown.ts`)

Attaches a WebSocket-client counter to an `http.Server` and fires `onShutdown` after the configured threshold of zero clients. Used by `ok start` to SIGTERM its `ok ui` sibling and tear down the collab process after a configurable idle window.

```ts
import { attachIdleShutdown } from '@inkeep/open-knowledge-server';

const handle = attachIdleShutdown({
  httpServer,                         // hocuspocus listener
  thresholdMs: 30 * 60 * 1000,        // 30 min default in ok start
  onShutdown: async () => {           // fired when counter stays at 0 for thresholdMs
    await sigtermSibling();           // e.g. SIGTERM ui.lock.pid
    await serverInstance.destroy();   // releases server.lock as its final step
  },
  warnBeforeMs: 5 * 60 * 1000,        // WARN log 5 min before shutdown (optional)
  log,                                // PinoLogger
  scheduler,                          // Scheduler injection for tests (precedent #13b)
});

handle.detach();                      // call from destroy() to cancel timers
```

- **"Idle"** = WebSocket upgrades at paths starting with `/collab`. `DirectConnection`-based writers (CC1 broadcaster, AgentSessionManager) are invisible to the counter **by design** (D-017 in the SPEC). Counter increments on upgrade, decrements on `socket close`.
- **Scheduler injection** — production passes the default `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`; tests pass a `ManualScheduler` for deterministic control (see CLAUDE.md precedent #13b).
- **Clean-up guarantees** — `detach()` is idempotent and must run inside the owner's `destroy()` so stale timers don't fire mid-shutdown.

Defined by SPEC §9 (US-002).

## CC1 push-over-awareness — contract v1

CC1 is the shared push primitive for derived-view invalidation (file list, backlinks, future graph panels). Rather than each client polling its own REST endpoint, the server emits a **pure signal** when the underlying data changes; clients respond by re-fetching the channel's canonical endpoint.

Contract authored in `specs/2026-04-13-v0-2-sidebar-push/SPEC.md` §9. V0-3 (BacklinksPanel) and V0-11 (graph panels) inherit this contract without revision.

### Payload shape

```ts
type CC1Signal = {
	v: 1;         // contract version; unknown v → skip + log at WARN
	ch: string;   // flat kebab-case channel name ('files', 'backlinks', 'graph', ...)
	seq: number;  // per-channel monotonic, starts at 1 per server process lifetime
};
```

No event kind, no path, no docName. Every signal says only "channel `ch` changed; re-fetch." `seq` is for dedup + observability, not for gating refetch.

### Transport

- Dedicated `__system__` Y.Doc, pre-materialized at server startup via `hocuspocus.openDirectConnection('__system__')` before the file watcher starts.
- Every client opens `__system__` on app mount via `ProviderPool` (pinned — does not count toward pool `maxSize`; skipped by LRU eviction).
- Server-side emission: `document.broadcastStateless(JSON.stringify(payload))` on the `__system__` Document.
- Client-side receive: `HocuspocusProvider({name: '__system__', onStateless: ({payload}) => ...})`.

### Channel ownership

Each channel's semantics are owned by its emitter. Adding a new `ch` value counts as a contract change (D2 signoff).

| Channel     | Emitted from                                                | Triggers                                                                                        | Canonical refetch             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `files`     | `standalone.ts` DiskEvent dispatch (V0-2, shipped)          | `create \| delete \| rename` DiskEvents only. `update` / `conflict` do not change the file list | `GET /api/documents`          |
| `backlinks` | `persistence.ts` backlink-index update path (V0-3, pending) | Content changes that invalidate the backlink index                                              | `GET /api/backlinks/:docName` |
| `graph`     | TBD (V0-11, pending)                                        | Graph-derived data changes                                                                      | TBD                           |

### Coalescing

Server-side **100 ms trailing-edge debounce per channel** (`CC1Broadcaster.signal(channel)` in `src/cc1-broadcast.ts`). Every incoming event restarts the timer; when the timer fires (no events for 100 ms) exactly one signal is broadcast. A `git checkout` touching 200 files collapses to one signal.

### Emitting (server-side)

```ts
import { CC1Broadcaster } from '@inkeep/open-knowledge-server';

const cc1Broadcaster = new CC1Broadcaster(hocuspocus);

// On any event that changes the 'files' channel:
cc1Broadcaster.signal('files');
```

Tear down on server shutdown with `cc1Broadcaster.destroy()` to clear pending debounce timers.

### Subscribing (client-side contract)

```ts
import { HocuspocusProvider } from '@hocuspocus/provider';
import { type CC1Signal, SYSTEM_DOC_NAME } from '@inkeep/open-knowledge-server';

const provider = new HocuspocusProvider({
	url: 'ws://localhost:5173/collab',
	name: SYSTEM_DOC_NAME, // '__system__'
	document: new Y.Doc(),
	onStateless: ({ payload }) => {
		let signal: CC1Signal;
		try {
			signal = JSON.parse(payload) as CC1Signal;
		} catch {
			return; // malformed — skip, never disconnect
		}
		if (signal.v !== 1) return; // unknown version — skip
		if (signal.ch === 'files') {
			// re-fetch GET /api/documents (at-most-one in flight per channel)
		}
	},
});
```

**Refetch discipline.** At most one refetch in flight per channel; coalesce redundant signals until the pending fetch returns. On WebSocket reconnect, refetch once unconditionally (recovers from missed signals during disconnect).

### Error handling (both sides)

| Condition                        | Behavior                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unknown `v` field                | Log at WARN; skip. Never disconnect.                                              |
| Unparseable JSON                 | Log at WARN; skip. Never disconnect.                                              |
| Unknown `ch` value               | Log at WARN; skip.                                                                |
| `__system__` doc missing on emit | Log once; drop the signal (startup race before `openDirectConnection` completes). |
| `seq` dedup                      | Client-side concern; server always increments.                                    |

### Cross-cutting skip surface (`isSystemDoc`)

`__system__` is not a content doc. Any subsystem that keys off `documentName` MUST call `isSystemDoc(documentName)` (exported from `cc1-broadcast.ts`) at its entry point. Audited subsystems that already do so:

- `persistence.ts` — `onLoadDocument`, `onStoreDocument` return early
- `file-watcher.ts` — `__system__` never appears in the in-memory file index
- `content-filter.ts` — reserved-name tripwire; rejects user-created `__system__.md`
- `reconciliation.ts` — no `reconciledBase` entry
- `backlink-index.ts` — no index entries
- `agent-sessions.ts` — no agent session state
- `external-change.ts` — skipped at dispatch
- Frontmatter cache (inside `persistence.ts`) — no cache entry

Reserved-name policy: `ContentFilter` rejects `__system__.md` at admit time; `POST /api/create-page` returns 400 on that name.

**If a new subsystem forgets this check,** the L1 integration test (`packages/app/tests/integration/cc1-broadcast.test.ts`) will fail its zero-state assertion after 10 broadcasts.

### Observability

`src/metrics.ts` exposes three CC1 counters, returned by `GET /api/metrics/reconciliation`:

| Counter              | Meaning                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cc1BroadcastCount`  | Total signals broadcast across all channels since process start |
| `cc1SubscriberCount` | Current `__system__` Document connection count                  |
| `cc1LastSeq`         | `Record<channel, number>` of the most recent `seq` per channel  |

### Reserved names

- `__system__` — CC1 broadcast target (v1).
- Future `cc1:*` names — reserved for additional CC1 internal channels. Treat as 1-way-door; lock before any consumer adopts.
