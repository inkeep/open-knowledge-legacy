/**
 * Client-side Yjs persistence primitive (Shape 2+).
 *
 * Wraps upstream `y-indexeddb` in a narrow, typed surface the
 * ProviderPool uses to:
 *   1. Hydrate a Y.Doc from browser IndexedDB on cold mount (instant
 *      Cmd-R).
 *   2. Wipe the IndexedDB copy on `server-instance-mismatch` so a
 *      restart doesn't mix pre- and post-restart CRDT items.
 *   3. Compute the client's unsynced delta (relative to the last
 *      server-acked state vector) so the ProviderPool can replay it
 *      onto the fresh provider after mismatch-recycle.
 *
 * IDB database names follow the canonical Yjs-ecosystem pattern of
 * "DB-per-tenant, named synchronously" (AFFiNE, tldraw, Liveblocks).
 * Format: `ok-ydoc:${branch}:${docName}` — branch is the tenant key,
 * docName is the resource within. Different branches → different IDBs
 * by construction, eliminating cross-branch ghost-item bleed without
 * relying on a synchronous `localStorage` + IDB co-eviction assumption.
 *
 * `UNKNOWN_BRANCH_SENTINEL` is the placeholder used when the pool has
 * not yet observed a branch (cold-boot tab with no persisted
 * `lastObservedBranch`). The IDB at the sentinel name will be empty
 * (never written to in production); auth-token mismatch on first
 * connect drives the recycle to the correct branch-prefixed name.
 *
 * Origin filtering (no write-back loop) is inherent to upstream
 * `y-indexeddb`: its `_storeUpdate` listener short-circuits when the
 * update origin equals the persistence instance itself, which is the
 * origin it passes to `Y.transact` during hydration.
 *
 * See specs/2026-04-24-client-persistence-replaces-sidecar/SPEC.md Phase 2.

/**
 * Branch identifier used when no `lastObservedBranch` is available
 * (fresh tab, cleared localStorage) and the boot fetch hasn't yet
 * completed. Mirrors the `__system__` pseudo-doc's leading-and-trailing
 * underscore convention.
 *
 * `_unknown_` is NOT structurally rejected by git — `git branch _unknown_`
 * succeeds. The sentinel is deliberately shaped to be unusual but
 * collision is theoretically possible. Operational impact of a real
 * `_unknown_` branch is zero: the auth-token claim on first connect
 * carries `expectedBranch: '_unknown_'`; if the server's actual branch
 * matches, the IDB is correctly scoped; if not, the
 * `branch-mismatch` recycle path (server's `onAuthenticate` reject →
 * client's `handleServerInstanceMismatch` recycle) reconciles via
 * IDB clear + fresh provider, which is the same recovery used for any
 * other stale-claim scenario.
 *
 * Storage hygiene caveat: `ok-ydoc:_unknown_:<docName>` IDBs may
 * accumulate when the cold-tab branch-mismatch recovery fails before
 * the IDB is cleared. Two failure paths leave orphans:
 *
 *   1. `/api/server-info` unreachable (network blip, server still
 *      booting) — `DocumentContext.tsx`'s mismatch handler logs
 *      `branch-mismatch-recovery-failed` and skips the recycle.
 *   2. Tab close mid-recycle — destroy chain doesn't await the
 *      `clearData` promise.
 *
 * Each failed-recovery cycle leaves at most one `_unknown_`-prefixed
 * IDB per docName (same docName overwrites). Bounded by docName
 * cardinality; harmless under browser quota; not a correctness bug
 * (all of these IDBs would correctly trigger `branch-mismatch` on
 * the next session and be cleared via the recycle path). Documented
 * here following the `localStorage`+IDB co-eviction precedent at
 * `provider-pool.ts:lastObservedBranch` — a symmetric storage-hygiene
 * note rather than a code-level cleanup. Opportunistic enumeration
 * via `indexedDB.databases()` was considered but rejected: the
 * cleanup path could race a mid-recovery reuse of the sentinel-
 * prefixed IDB and delete an in-use database.
