Markdown pipeline engineering health — 21 P0 requirements landing across perf measurement, code refactors, fidelity fixes, test tightening, and CI infrastructure.

**Perf measurement:** seeded synthetic benchmark corpus + committed harness with pinned methodology (10 warm-ups, `Bun.gc(true)`, `bun@1.3.11`); re-measured baseline at 7 block counts; per-stage profile harness + published findings; calibrated perf regression gate (`max(2× p99 variance, 10% floor)`) + parse-health gate (`parseFallback.wholeDoc === 0`) in tier-2 CI.

**Code refactors:** R23 guard `O(n·m) → O(n log n)` via pre-indexed tag-offset map + binary search (568.88ms → 4.76ms on pathological corpus); processor caching at `MarkdownManager` construction + idempotency refactor for both `remarkMdxAgnostic` and `remarkWikiLink` attachers; 2-phase merged post-parse walker (Phase A restoration + Phase B merged dispatcher) gated by one-time byte-for-byte mdast diff validator on 714 fixtures; structural PM↔mdast fix — `hydrateMarks` outside-in greedy (library patch), `Code` mark `excludes: '_'` widened via `CodeMarkFidelity` (schema widening per precedent #9), context-aware backslash-before-entity policy.

**Fidelity:** all 6 CommonMark serialization bugs fixed. CommonMark corpus 652/652 idempotent; `KNOWN_CRASH_CEILING` lowered from 50 to 0; all 19 formerly-NORMALIZE sections promoted to byte-identity idempotence assertion.

**Test tightening:** NG1 + NG11 byte-identity pinning; I3's `markdownDoc` arbitrary parametric blank-line joiner; 6 new PBT invariants (emphasis-cumulation, backslash-idempotence, list-nesting, html-block-edge, link-edge, image-edge) green at 1K samples; `parseWithFallback` perf bound (≤5× happy-path) + parametric `MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH` boundary test.

**Infrastructure:** all markdown fixtures consolidated into `packages/core/src/markdown/fixtures/{commonmark,gfm,mdx,wiki-links,frontmatter,ng-pinned,perf}/` with typed loader helpers; all 7 stale `@tiptap/markdown` references removed; three CI tiers (`ci.yml` / `nightly.yml` / `weekly.yml`) calibrated against measured baselines.
