feat(editor): asset upload + `![[file.ext]]` wiki-embed surface

Any file drop is accepted by the editor — there is no user-facing byte cap. PDFs, video, audio, archives, and fonts stop hitting the old "Unsupported file type" dead-end. The emit shape is picked by extension: markdown files (`.md` / `.mdx`) emit as `[[basename]]` wiki-links (link-semantic, navigable on Cmd-click, resolved via `fileIndex` — markdown is a first-class OK doc, not an opaque asset); images + typed renderable files (PDF, MP4, WebM, MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, MOV) emit as `![[file.ext]]` wiki-embeds; opaque files emit as `[name](path)` markdown links. Uploads stream to disk end-to-end (memory footprint is O(1), not O(fileSize)), so the only rejection axis is disk fullness (`storage-full` → HTTP 507). See [`reports/streaming-upload-refactor/REPORT.md`](reports/streaming-upload-refactor/REPORT.md) for the refactor rationale.

Same-directory sha256 dedup returns existing paths on duplicate drops with a toast (`"Already at <path> — reusing."`). Renaming a doc that contains image refs recomputes the relative path; absolute refs and wiki-embed refs are untouched because the basename index resolves them dynamically.

New HTTP surface on the server:

- `POST /api/upload` — upload endpoint. Success response (per `UploadAssetSuccessSchema` in `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core`): flat `{ src, path, deduped, sha?, byteLength? }` where `src` is the asset's basename and `path` is the contentDir-relative location (colocated with the referencing doc). Error responses are RFC 9457 problem details (`application/problem+json`) with `type ∈ {urn:ok:error:malformed-upload, urn:ok:error:storage-full, urn:ok:error:storage-readonly, urn:ok:error:collision-exhaustion, urn:ok:error:storage-error}` plus `title`, `status`, and `instance` correlation UUID. See the [`api-design-hardening` changeset](api-design-hardening.md) for the cross-handler RFC 9457 envelope.

No user-facing `upload.*` config. Attachment placement (co-located), emit shape (`![[...]]` for supported extensions), same-directory sha256 dedup with a toast notice, and the wiki-embed extension list are fixed defaults. Every value is a module-level constant in `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core/constants/upload.ts`. One-shot Obsidian-vault migration CLI deferred to a future spec — OK does not read `.obsidian/app.json` at runtime; refugees whose vault uses non-default config shape wait for the future migrator. Legacy configs still carrying `upload.*` keys parse cleanly (unknown keys are silently stripped).

File watcher now emits `asset-create` / `asset-delete` DiskEvents alongside the existing markdown events; CC1 `ch:'files'` signal coalesces both so file-sidebar and basename-index rebuilds piggyback on one broadcast. `sanitizeFilename` preserves Unicode code points (letters, digits, marks, punctuation, emoji) while stripping path separators and control bytes.

Full spec + decision log (D1–D-M): [`specs/2026-04-16-editor-asset-and-embed-surface/SPEC.md`](specs/2026-04-16-editor-asset-and-embed-surface/SPEC.md). Operator-facing guide: [Assets and embeds](docs/content/guides/assets-and-embeds.mdx).

**Asset-click dispatcher + OS-integration surface (2026-04-23 amendment).** Click a `![[meeting.pdf]]` embed and the PDF opens predictably — a new browser tab in web, `shell.openPath` in Electron. Previously post-reload clicks routed through the doc-link navigator and failed silently (Gap 3b); Electron drop-time clicks replaced the editor window (Gap 4). Both gaps close.

- `ClassifiedLinkTarget` gains a first-class `{kind: 'asset', url, ext}` variant; `resolveAssetProjectPath` resolves relative hrefs against the source doc's directory.
- Renderer-side dispatcher + empty-at-landing viewer registry at `packages/app/src/editor/asset-dispatch/` — future PRs register PDF.js / image lightbox / video-audio viewers as ~40-60 LOC plugins without modifying the dispatch layer.
- Three new Electron IPC channels (`ok:shell:open-asset`, `ok:shell:reveal-asset`, `ok:shell:show-asset-menu`). Main-process `openAssetSafely` enforces path containment (`realpath` + `isPathWithinProject`), existence, and an executable-extension blocklist (`.exe`/`.sh`/`.html`/`.svg`/…) source-verified from Obsidian 1.12.7. Renderer sends project-relative paths; containment fires at the IPC boundary.
- Right-click any on-disk reference (asset chip, wiki-link chip, image) → native OS menu with Reveal in Finder / Show in Explorer + Open in default app + Copy link. Gesture-attested (main observes the click directly).
- Defense-in-depth: `setWindowOpenHandler` + `will-navigate` on the editor webContents intercept any asset URL that escapes the renderer dispatcher (pasted `<a href>`, plugin content, drop-time `<a target="_blank">`). Same path containment + blocklist enforced on every entry point.

Full amendment (US-A1..A6, FR-A1..A8, NG-A1..A6, D-A1..A12): [`specs/2026-04-16-editor-asset-and-embed-surface/SPEC.md`](specs/2026-04-16-editor-asset-and-embed-surface/SPEC.md) §Post-finalization amendment (2026-04-23).
