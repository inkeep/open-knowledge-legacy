feat(desktop): M6 CLI-on-PATH install + first-launch MCP consent.

Closes M6's DOD on the Electron desktop app. Two phased deliverables on one branch:

- **M6a — Install Command-Line Tools…** menu item (macOS only). Click → admin prompt → `/usr/local/bin/ok` + `/usr/local/bin/open-knowledge` symlinks pointing at the bundled wrapper. Wrapper uses `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` to host the CLI under the bundled Electron binary — no separate Node install required (D17 amendment flips `RunAsNode` fuse to `true`; VS Code / Atom precedent). Translocation guard refuses install from DMG mount; collision guard prompts before stomping foreign files; G5 launch-time repair offers re-link when symlinks point at a removed bundle.
- **M6b — first-launch MCP consent dialog** (host-agnostic; renders in whichever window opens first per D-M6-R10). User-scoped marker at `~/.open-knowledge/mcp-status.json` fires the dialog exactly once per user per Mac. Detected editors preselected (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Windsurf — `detectInstalledEditors` already global-scoped). Add → per-editor MCP config writes via NEW CLI export `writeUserMcpConfigs(opts)` (NOT `runInit` — `runInit` runs `ensureProjectGit` + `initContent` + `scaffoldLaunchJson` + `upsertRootInstructions` which would `git init /` from a packaged Electron app's `process.cwd()`). Hybrid `cliPath` per D-M6-R9: `/usr/local/bin/ok` when M6a installed AND ownership-checked, bundle-absolute `Resources/cli/bin/ok.sh` otherwise.

Public-surface additions to `@inkeep/open-knowledge` (the published CLI):

- `writeUserMcpConfigs(opts: UserMcpConfigsOptions): Promise<EditorMcpResult[]>` — new export. Writes per-editor MCP entries without `runInit`'s project-scoped side effects. Surface for Electron main; CLI `ok init` from terminal continues to use `runInit` unchanged.
- `UserMcpConfigsOptions` interface — `{editors, force?:boolean|Set<EditorId>, cliPath?:string, home?:string}`.
- `readExistingMcpEntry(target, cwd, home?)` — new export. Format-aware (JSON / TOML) tolerant reader. Never throws — returns `null` on absent / unparseable / shape-incompatible config.
- `writeEditorMcpConfig` — promoted from private to exported (was already declared at `init.ts`, now available via the public surface).
- `McpInstallOptions.cliPath?: string` — new optional field. Highest-precedence branch in `buildManagedServerEntry`: `{command: cliPath, args: ['mcp']}`. Backward-compatible — existing `ok init` calls without `cliPath` continue to produce the canonical `{command:'npx', args:['@inkeep/open-knowledge','mcp']}` shape.

Notable implementation decisions:

- `confirmHandler` returns `{ok:false, error: <user-readable>}` on partial-write failure — sonner toast surfaces the failure to the user since the dialog itself unmounts on result resolution. Marker stays absent (deferred-marker per OQ-19) so the dialog re-fires next launch for retry.
- Renderer-ready handshake (D-M6-R10) registers a one-shot `ok:mcp-wiring:renderer-ready` invoke handler; main responds with `ok:mcp-wiring:show` to the same WebContents and removes the handler ONLY on successful dispatch — so a failed first dispatch keeps the handler armed for the next renderer's mount-ack.
- POSIX-safe shell escape on the install-script command builders — apostrophes in bundle paths (renamed `.app`, account name with `'`, etc.) cannot inject root commands through the `osascript ... do shell script "..." with administrator privileges` chain.
- Atomic marker writes via `tmp+rename` — mirrors `state-store.saveAppStateToDir` so power-loss between write and fsync can't leave a truncated marker.
- macOS-only v0 per D51. Windows/Linux NG4 paths remain `NOT NOW`.
