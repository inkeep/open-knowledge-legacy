feat(agent-writes): optional `summary` on all four MCP write tools — renders as collapsible bullets on the Timeline row so readers can scan agent intent without opening every diff.

Agents calling `write_document`, `edit_document`, `rename_document`, or `rollback_to_version` can now pass an optional one-line `summary` describing the outcome of the edit (e.g. `"Fixed token-refresh race"`). Summaries persist per-contributor to the shadow-repo `ok-contributors:` JSON line and render under the author on the [[timeline]] WIP row — first bullet inline, the rest collapsed behind a "Show N more" expander matching the existing `WipGroup` pattern. The doc-list stays visible as ground truth alongside the bullets.

- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` — `ShadowContributor` gains `summaries?: string[]` (flat per-contributor array, oldest-first). `parseContributors` accepts both legacy (no field) and new shapes; malformed `summaries` values drop just that field while preserving the contributor entry — a deliberate divergence from the whole-entry-skip convention so decorative loss (no bullets) never escalates to attribution loss.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` — new `agent-write-summary.ts` exports `normalizeSummary` as the single API-boundary truncation point (80-char cap, U+2026 suffix when truncated; whitespace-only and empty strings classify as `absent`). `recordContributor` threads through the optional 5th-arg summary; `formatContributorsFrom` emits `summaries` on the `ok-contributors:` line only when non-empty so summary-less writes stay byte-identical to today. Five API handlers (`/api/agent-write`, `/api/agent-write-md`, `/api/agent-patch`, `/api/rename`, `/api/rollback`) accept the optional body field and return `summary: {value, truncatedFrom?}` + a human-readable hint when truncation fires. Three new metrics counters (`agentWriteCalls`, `summariesProvided`, `summariesTruncated`) track M1 adoption and M2 cap efficacy. `handleRename` and `handleRollback` now call `extractAgentIdentity` + `recordContributor` — **but only when the request body carries an explicit `agentId`** (D22 LOCKED), so the in-editor Restore button (which posts with no identity) stays anonymous on the timeline as it always has. MCP-driven rename and rollback calls get a server-generated default summary (`"Renamed <from> → <to>"` / `"Restored to <sha-short>"`) when the agent omits one.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge` — the four write MCP tools expose `summary` in their Zod schemas (Zod hard-cap of 200 chars as a transport-safety bound separate from the 80-char rendering cap); `rename_document` and `rollback_to_version` also thread agent identity (`agentId`/`agentName`/`clientName`/`colorSeed`) matching the pattern from `write-document.ts` so summary attribution lands correctly. Tool descriptions include the cap, the rename/rollback defaults, and a no-PII/secrets hint.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` — `TimelinePanel` `EntryRow` renders the collapsible bullet list when any contributor on the row has `summaries`; zero regression for legacy rows without the field. The doc-list line stays as ground truth alongside the bullets.

The `ok-contributors:` JSON line stays at `v: 1` — `summaries` is purely additive (precedent #9). Legacy commits (no field) and summary-less writes (field omitted) both remain byte-identical to pre-feature behavior. `exec` / `read_document` enrichment carries the field through automatically via `history.contributors[*].summaries`.
