feat(desktop): M4 `openknowledge://` URL scheme end-to-end.

Closes M4's DOD in the Electron desktop app. Clicking `openknowledge://open?project=<abs-path>&doc=<name>` from any surface (Terminal `open`, Mail/Slack hyperlinks, MCP tool responses in Claude Desktop) routes the user to the right project window with the renderer navigated to the target doc. Unblocks M6: MCP `preview-url.ts` now emits `openknowledge://` URLs when running inside Electron (gated on `OK_ELECTRON_PROTOCOL_HOST=1`, set at utility fork), and falls through to `http://localhost/...` for CLI/bunx consumers.

Implementation details: synchronous top-level `open-url` listener registration (per electron/electron#32600 — `open-url` can fire before `will-finish-launching` OR `ready` on macOS); VS Code-style queue-then-flush with 10 × 500ms retries; `second-instance` argv scan for CLI-style launches; `realpathSync`-canonicalized `windowsByPath` keys; `dom-ready`-gated `sendDeepLink` on cold spawns to defeat subscriber-mount races; dev-mode `setAsDefaultProtocolClient('openknowledge')` with `before-quit` cleanup via `removeAsDefaultProtocolClient` (prevents stale Launch Services bindings to deleted worktrees). Path-traversal defense rejects null bytes (pre-decode + post-decode for layered `%2500` shapes), URL-decodes, then checks the raw decoded string for `..` segments before normalization — `path.resolve`'s silent-flatten behavior makes equality-style gates insufficient. `shell.openExternal` scheme allowlist (`https`, `http`, `mailto`, `openknowledge`) enforced at the main-process boundary per D47. Nested doc names (`notes/meeting-2026`) round-trip correctly via `encodeURIComponent` on both producer (preview-url) and consumer (renderer hash nav) sides.

macOS-only v0 per D51. Windows/Linux NG1/NG2 paths remain `NOT NOW`. Cold-start Apple-Event delivery requires signed DMG + Launch Services binding — deferred to M3/M7 and captured as a named `test.skip` in `deep-link.e2e.ts` for explicit CI visibility.
