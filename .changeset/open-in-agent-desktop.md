feat(handoff): "Open in Agent Desktop" — one-click handoff from Open Knowledge to Claude Cowork / Claude Code / OpenAI Codex Desktop / Cursor.

A new "Open in…" dropdown surfaces from three places — the editor header action strip, the `Cmd+K` command palette ("Open in agent" group), and the file-tree right-click menu — routing every click through a single `dispatchHandoff` entry point (AC9 asserts no other dispatch sites). Each enabled row fires the target's canonical URL scheme through the existing `shell.openExternal` IPC (Electron host) or an anchor-click (web host), with a minimal auto-composed prompt that points the target agent at the doc plus a hint to use the `open-knowledge` MCP for backlinks + related context. Disabled rows render with a keyboard-reachable submenu — install link + `Open in claude.ai →` secondary affordance on Claude rows — instead of a non-interactive tooltip.

Built on four pure URL builders in the new `packages/core/src/handoff/` (`claude-url.ts`, `codex-url.ts`, `cursor-url.ts`, `web-fallback-url.ts`) with an encoding discipline pinned against Cursor's two-pass-decode behavior (`text=` double-encoded, `workspace=` single-encoded basename, `mode=agent` literal). The Cursor two-step dispatcher (`cursor-two-step.ts`, Electron only per E4 DIRECTED) spawns the workspace first through a dedicated `ok:shell:spawn-cursor` IPC — distinct from the URL-scheme allowlist because the threat model is a command allowlist — then fires the `cursor://` prompt after a 1000–1500 ms settle. On macOS the spawn routes through `/usr/bin/open -a <bundle>` because `app.getApplicationInfoForProtocol('cursor://')` returns the `.app` bundle (a directory), not an executable.

Install detection is unified across hosts: Electron uses `app.getApplicationInfoForProtocol(scheme)` per probe (with an `xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/<name>` fallback on Linux); web uses a new `GET /api/installed-agents` endpoint with a per-scheme 60 s server-side cache, a 10 s per-client refresh throttle, and the standard `checkLocalOpSecurity` loopback + Host-header gate. Windows probes the merged `HKCR` view so machine-scope (HKLM) installers are detected alongside user-scope. Web-host Cursor is always disabled-with-tooltip regardless of probe result (E4 DIRECTED — local-use-case only; the `/api/handoff/open-folder` cross-machine primitive is deferred).

Security: `packages/desktop/src/main/shell-allowlist.ts` (D47) extended with `claude:`, `codex:`, `cursor:` behind per-scheme JSDoc and an exact-set test. A drift-detector in `shell-allowlist.test.ts` reads `KNOWN_TARGETS` and fails if any future target lands without an allowlist row. Every outbound URL is built by a typed pure function — never from user-supplied raw URL strings.

Observability: `~/.open-knowledge/stats.jsonl` append-only per dispatch (zero phone-home per XQ3 LOCKED). Success/failure sonner toasts close the DC3/DC4/vendor-drift silent-failure gap, with a bounded retry (2–3 attempts; distinct copy on the final failure) per review M5.
