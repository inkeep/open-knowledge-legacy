feat(shadow-repo): collapse dual-mode to single-mode at `<projectRoot>/.git/open-knowledge/`, auto-`git init` on first run when no parent repo exists, and rename legacy `.git/openknowledge/` shadows in place.

The shadow repo (OK's attribution journal for WIP refs, upstream imports, checkpoints, and the rescue timeline) previously branched between `integrated` mode at `<root>/.git/openknowledge/` and `standalone` mode at `<root>/.openknowledge/`. Standalone mode had semantically distinct behavior — no parent `.git/HEAD` for the HEAD watcher, no real project branch for the `refs/wip/<branch>/<writer-id>` namespace, no upstream-import path — which forced every shadow-touching change through a two-mode test matrix for zero user-facing payoff. The dual-mode split is now gone: the shadow always lives at `<projectRoot>/.git/open-knowledge/`, projects without `.git/` get auto-`git init`'d by the new `ensureProjectGit` helper (fail-fast on missing git — no degraded fallback), and legacy `.git/openknowledge/` shadows are silently `renameSync`-migrated on first run so pre-spec users keep their attribution history.

- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-core` — `resolveShadowDir(projectRoot: string): string` — return type collapses from `{ path, mode }` to a plain string; `ShadowRepoMode` and `ResolvedShadowDir` types are deleted. `OkDesktopBridge` gains `onGitInitNotice(cb)` alongside the existing `onProjectSwitched` / `onMenuAction` push-event surfaces.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` — new `ensureProjectGit` + `ProjectGitInitError` exports (pre-listen fail-fast hook). `BootServerOptions` gains `ensureProjectGitFn`; `BootedServer` gains `didGitInit`. `initShadowRepo` carries a ~5-line R9 rename shim for legacy layouts. `skipAutoInit` now gates both `ensureProjectGitFn` and `autoInitFn`.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge` — `ok start` and `ok init` call `ensureProjectGit(cwd)` in the fresh-directory path; the CLI preview-block gate extends to `didAutoInit || didGitInit` and emits `Initialized git repo at <cwd>/.git/ (default branch: main)`. `ok mcp` is unchanged directly but inherits the side effect transitively when it auto-spawns `ok start` (opt out with `OK_MCP_AUTOSTART=0` or config `mcp.autoStart: false`). `.gitignore` auto-append of `.openknowledge/` is deleted; `.openknowledge` is removed from `enrichment.ts` / `mtime-scan.ts` scan-exclusion sets.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-desktop` — utility process passes `ensureProjectGitFn` to `bootServer`; `UtilityReadyMessage` carries `didGitInit`. New `git-init-notice` push event on the preload bridge; main-side dispatch deferred until `webContents.once('dom-ready', ...)` to defeat the subscriber-mount race.
- `@inkeep/open-knowledge-app` — renderer subscriber (`lib/install-git-init-toast.ts`, wired imperatively in `main.tsx`) routes `onGitInitNotice` to `toast.info(\`Initialized git repo at ${gitDir}\`)`. No-op outside Electron.

Legacy `.openknowledge/` standalone-mode directories are silent orphans (no detection, no warning, no migration) — OK carries zero runtime reference to that path per D5/NG5. Worktree-specific semantics are out of scope for this change; they remain owned by a separate spec (NG6).
